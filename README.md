### Starting Point

I used [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as a starting point. It seemed liked the ideal tool for a "one-off" project. Getting a development server and production build with Typescript and ES6 support with minimal configuration was convenient.


### Design Considerations

#### Dependencies

##### react

I used the new Hooks API to build my React components. I hadn't used it previously but saw this project as a good opportunity to get familiar with and evaluate the new API (I also noticed it was used in the signal-desktop project). I quite liked it. I would be comfortable writing the component logic using classes as well.

##### redux-thunk

I used Redux Thunk to be able to access state inside action creators. I wanted to isolate as much logic between data and presentation layers as possible and this lead to fairly simple components.

##### @giphy/react-components

_@giphy/react-components_ is being used for its `Gif` component. This component 1) removes the GIF from the DOM when it isn't visible in the viewport, allow hundreds of GIFs to be loaded on the page at once with constant client CPU usage and 2) detects WebP support and renders the optimal format for the client's browser. In future work a replacement component could be written, directly swapped in, and this dependency removed, as it currently represents 69KB (23%) of the build size.

#### Testing

I wrote fairly robust tests for action creators, reducers and selectors. At this time I've written one very minimal test for components.
